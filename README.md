# city app - info about cities in the U.S.

**tech**: React.js, JavaScript, APIs, HTML, CSS

**current features**:
- search bar with city autocomplete/dropdown
- current weather
- current local time
- location of city on map of U.S. (works for all states)
- forecast for the next 24 hours (clickable; show more details)

**features to be added:**
- keep track of cities previously searched by creating a backend (Node.js)

**areas of improvement**:
- search bar only displays 5 dropdown options; cannot find some cities in different states with same name
- map doesn't work for U.S. territories
